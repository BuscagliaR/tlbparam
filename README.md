## Primary Public Commit

Package was made public for download December 14th, 2022. Package contains two primary functions:

**load_thermograms()** - generates properly formatted data.frame for use by clean_thermograms()

**clean_thermograms()** - generates thermogram parameters for all provided samples.

Several other depedent functions are present with vignette descriptions.

### Thermogram Parameters and Descriptions

The thermogram parameters generated by clean_thermograms() are:

**$Peak ~1$**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 1 temperature region (60 - 66 C)

**$Peak ~2$**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 2 temperature region (67 - 73 C)

**$Peak ~3$**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 3 temperature region (73 - 81 C)

**$T_{Peak~1}$**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 1.

**$T_{Peak~2}$**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 2.

**$T_{Peak~3}$**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 3.

**$Peak1/Peak2$**: Peak 1 to Peak 2 ratio.

**$Peak1/Peak3$**: Peak 1 to Peak 3 ratio.

**$Peak2/Peak3$**: Peak 2 to Peak 3 ratio.

**$V1.2$**: Valley (minimum amplitude) between Peak 1 and Peak 2 (inclusive).

**$T_{V1.2}$**: Temperature of Valley between Peak 1 and Peak 2 (inclusive).

**$V1.2/Peak~1$**: Ratio of Valley between Peak 1 and Peak 2 to the amplitude of Peak 1.

**$V1.2/Peak~2$**: Ratio of Valley between Peak 1 and Peak 2 to the amplitude of Peak 2.

**$V1.2/Peak~3$**: Ratio of Valley between Peak 1 and Peak 2 to the amplitude of Peak 3.

**$Max$**: Maximum observed excess heat capacity

**$T_{Max}$**: Temperature corresponding to maximum height.

**$T_{FM}$**: Temperature corresponding to the first moment.

**$Width$**: Full width at half max

**$Area$**: Total area under the thermogram signature

Metrics below are available but were not used in most recent (Myocardial Injury 2024) work.

**`$`$min$**: Minimum observed excess heat capacity.

**`$`$T_{min}$**: Temperature corresponding to minimum observed excess heat capacity.

**`$`$Median$**: Median observed excess heat capacity

**`$`$T_{Peak~f}$**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Fibrinongen temperature region (47 - 60 C)

**`$`$Peak~f$**: Height of peak corresponding to Fibrinongen temperature region (47 - 60 C)

## Publications

The tlbparam package has been used in the following publications. Package has been updated for current submission of Myocardial Injury manuscript.

  1. Characterization of Myocardial Injury Phenotype by Thermal Liquid Biopsy. 2024. Frontiers in Cardiology. Submitted.

  2. Plasma Thermogram Parameters Differentiate Status and Overall Survival of Melanoma Patients. 2023. Current Oncology, 30(7), 6079-6096.

### Package Status and Future Updates

Functionality is also implemented in an online R-Shiny web application for non-R based users. ThermogramForge can be found by clicking [HERE]([https://pages.github.com/](https://rbuscaglia-thermogramforge.share.connect.posit.cloud/)). 

Please contact corresponding author for any information regarding current version metric formulas. Some dependencies still exists for data collected specific to the Garbett laboratory. Authors are working to update provided tutorials and use of packages through the R environment. Please email any questions or suggestions to the corresponding author.
