## Primary Public Commit

Package was made public for download December 14th, 2022. Package contains two primary functions:

**load_thermograms()** - generates properly formatted data.frame for use by clean_thermograms()

**clean_thermograms()** - generates thermogram parameters for all provided samples.

Several other depedent functions are present with vignette descriptions.

### Thermogram Parameters and Descriptions

The thermogram parameters generated by clean_thermograms() are:

**tarea**: Total area under the thermogram signature

**fwhm**: Full width at half max

**max**: Maximum observed excess heat capacity

**$tpeakf**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Fibrinongen temperature region (47 - 60 C)

**$peakf**: Height of peak corresponding to Fibrinongen temperature region (47 - 60 C)

**tpeak1**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 1 temperature region (60 - 67 C)

**peak1**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 1 temperature region (60 - 67 C)

**tpeak2**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 2 temperature region (67 - 73 C)

**peak2**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 2 temperature region (67 - 73 C)

**tpeak3**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 3 temperature region (73 - 78 C)

**peak3**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 3 temperature region (73 - 78 C)

**P1P2.trough**: Height of valley between Peak1 and Peak2

**tP1P2.trough**: Temperature of valley between Peak1 and Peak2.

**tmax**: Temperature corresponding to maximum height

**tfm**: Temperature corresponding to the first moment

**peak12ratio**: Peak 1 to Peak 2 ratio

**$min**: Minimum observed excess heat capacity.

**$tmin**: Temperature corresponding to minimum observed excess heat capacity.

**median**: Median observed excess heat capacity

## Melanoma Data Example

To obtain the thermogram metrics for the Melanoma data presented in "Plasma thermogram parameters differentiate status and overall survival of melanoma patients", please download the required packages files and run the R script 'Melanoma_Parameters_Example.R'. All metrics labeled with a $ indicates the parameter was not investigated for the Melanoma manuscript.

### Package Limitations

Some dependencies still exists for data collected specific to the Garbett laboratory.  Please email any questions or suggestions to the corresponding author.
