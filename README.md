## Primary Public Commit

Package was made public for download December 14th, 2022. Package contains two primary functions:

**load_thermograms()** - generates properly formatted data.frame for use by clean_thermograms()

**clean_thermograms()** - generates thermogram parameters for all provided samples.

Several other depedent functions are present with vignette descriptions.

### Thermogram Parameters and Descriptions

The thermogram parameters generated by clean_thermograms() are:

**Peak 1**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 1 temperature region (60 - 66 C)

**Peak 2**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 2 temperature region (67 - 73 C)

**Peak 3**: Height of peak corresponding to Peak 3 temperature region (73 - 81 C)

**T_{Peak} 1**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 1.

**T_{Peak} 2**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 2.

**T_{Peak} 3**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Peak 3.

**Peak 1/Peak 2**: Peak 1 to Peak 2 ratio.

**Peak 1/Peak 3**: Peak 1 to Peak 3 ratio.

**Peak 2/Peak 3**: Peak 2 to Peak 3 ratio.

**V1.2**: Valley (minimum amplitutde) between Peak 1 and Peak 2.

**T_{V1.2}**: Temperature of Valley between Peak 1 and Peak 2.

**tarea**: Total area under the thermogram signature

**fwhm**: Full width at half max

**max**: Maximum observed excess heat capacity

**Tmax**: Temperature corresponding to maximum height.

**T_{FM}**: Temperature corresponding to the first moment.

**$min**: Minimum observed excess heat capacity.

**$tmin**: Temperature corresponding to minimum observed excess heat capacity.

**$median**: Median observed excess heat capacity

**$tpeakf**: Temperature of peak corresponding to Fibrinongen temperature region (47 - 60 C)

**$peakf**: Height of peak corresponding to Fibrinongen temperature region (47 - 60 C)


## Melanoma Data Example

To obtain the thermogram metrics for the Melanoma data presented in "Plasma thermogram parameters differentiate status and overall survival of melanoma patients", please download the required packages files and run the R script 'Melanoma_Parameters_Example.R'. All metrics labeled with a $ indicates the parameter was not investigated for the Melanoma manuscript.
